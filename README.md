# 🔐 File Integrity with Hashing (SHA256)

This project demonstrates how **cryptographic hashing** (using SHA256) can be used to verify file integrity and detect tampering.  
Even a single-bit change in a file produces a completely different hash value, making this technique essential for maintaining data security.

## 📌 Overview
- Learn how to generate file hashes using `sha256sum` in Linux.  
- Save trusted hash values for later verification.  
- Detect unauthorized modifications using checksum comparisons.  
- Experience an **interactive terminal-style walkthrough** of hashing in action.
